## React Component for Journeys

Allows a dev to define a an entire UI as objects.

The JourneyRenderer is built from the combination of the JourneyDefinition + JourneyManager + JourneyDisplay. These things together allow the developer in a consuming application to define how components should be displayed, but not need to worry about the relationship between those screens.

This fits in with the [Ideal Design+Dev](https://www.figma.com/file/EgT9kWOiREjvcf9hq7RKDT/FE-Process-Diagram-(IDEAL)?node-id=0%3A1) process

### Component usage
```js
import {
  JourneyDisplay,
  getJourneyManager,
} from '@koodoo/koomeleon.ui.journey-renderer';
import { exampleJourney } from './example-data/demo-journey';

const ourJM = getJourneyManager(exampleJourney);
<JourneyDisplay journeyManager={ourJM} />
```
